//design one object per question with keys including question then answerOne Two etc..

// for i in questionArr maybe with each stop of the game iterates to next set of questions





//use function to populate ID with those by iterating.  So create array of objects then pass them as argument?
//as part of freeze timer, if question = q1 display correct image

//setTimeout for answer reveal page that calls function of next question

//if answer x then .html this stuff and do 3 second countdown or .html this other stuff a do countdown as well

//I guess that static answer page with countdown is its own function









//scoreboard object featuring correct incorrect and unanswered to be entered in answer divs on final page
