//use click event for start button to call the first question 

//Use element Ids and jQuery to label answer divs, 4 per question with click.
//also use hover event on each answer div

//use stopwatch functionality or set TimeOut?  including reset function to be called for each question page, putting starting time in clock div to begin countdown.

//And StopInterval function


//design one object per question with keys including question then answerOne Two etc..

//setTimeout for answer reveal page that calls function of next question

//if answer x then .html this stuff and do 3 second countdown or .html this other stuff a do countdown as well

//I guess that static answer page with countdown is its own function









//scoreboard object featuring correct incorrect and unanswered to be entered in answer divs on final page
